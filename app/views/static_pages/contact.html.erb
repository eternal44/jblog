<h3>About This Blog</h3>
  <ul>
    <p>This blog captures some of my thoughts on how I'm learning to code
    as well as my career transition into full-time developing.</p>

    <p>I've been doing bizdev / sales for small companies and startups for
    the past 6 years and have been a passionate hobbyist for the past 2 years.
    Whether it be improving bottom lines or writing lines of code there's
    something immensly satisfying in creating something into existance.
